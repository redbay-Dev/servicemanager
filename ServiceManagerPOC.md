# Service Manager Proof of Concept

## Overview
A simple desktop application to manage and monitor development services with a focus on ease of use and quick setup.

## Core Features

### 1. Project Management
- Add new projects with name and description
- Save project-specific start/stop commands
- Organize projects into categories
- Quick access to frequently used projects

### 2. Service Control
- Start/stop individual services
- Run multiple services simultaneously
- View real-time status of running services
- Basic error monitoring and alerts

### 3. Command Management
- Save and organize frequently used commands
- Quick access to saved commands
- Command history with timestamps
- Basic command templates

### 4. Monitoring
- Simple status indicators for each service
- Basic log viewing
- CPU and memory usage monitoring
- Service uptime tracking

## Technical Specifications

### Frontend:
- Electron.js for cross-platform desktop app
- React.js for UI components
- Tailwind CSS for styling

### Backend:
- Node.js for core functionality
- Child process management for service control
- SQLite for local data storage

### Initial Scope:
1. Project creation and management
2. Basic service control (start/stop)
3. Simple monitoring interface
4. Command history and templates

## Example Workflow

1. Add a new project:
   - Name: "Web App"
   - Description: "Main frontend application"
   - Commands:
     - Start: "cd C:\Software_Dev\Allocateit\web-app && npm run dev:all"
     - Stop: "Ctrl+C"

2. Add another project:
   - Name: "Docker Services"
   - Description: "Backend and database"
   - Commands:
     - Start: "docker-compose up -d"
     - Stop: "docker-compose down"

3. Use the app:
   - Select "Web App" and click "Start"
   - Select "Docker Services" and click "Start"
   - Monitor status in the dashboard
   - Stop services when needed

## Future Expansion Possibilities
- Advanced monitoring and logging
- Team collaboration features
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- Plugin system for extended functionality
- VSCode extension integration

## Development Plan

### Phase 1 (1 week):
- Basic project management
- Simple service control
- Minimal UI

### Phase 2 (1 week):
- Command history and templates
- Basic monitoring
- UI improvements

### Phase 3 (1 week):
- Error handling and alerts
- Performance optimization
- Final testing and polish

This proof of concept provides a solid foundation for the service manager while keeping the scope manageable for initial development. It can be expanded into a more comprehensive tool as needed.
