WHAT IS IT?
DevControl is a desktop app that helps developers manage their entire development workflow in one place. From creating new projects to deploying to production, everything is controlled from a single interface.

CORE FUNCTIONALITY:

1. Project Creation:
- Developer opens app and clicks "Create New Project"
- Chooses what kind of project (website, mobile app, etc.)
- Picks technologies they want to use
- Selects from pre-configured stacks (e.g., MERN, LAMP, MEAN)
- AI recommendations for optimal project setup
- App automatically sets up all necessary files and tools
- Everything's ready to start coding in minutes
- Community-contributed project templates available

2. Development Environment:
- One screen shows everything you need
- All servers/services start with one click
- Live view of any errors or problems
- Built-in terminal when needed
